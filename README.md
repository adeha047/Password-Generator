# Password-Generator
I added Javascript code used when someone requests a new password.
I provided certain prompts to elicit the variables used in the new password. 
I worked on randomizing the password using a get random function. 
I created variables to account for each possible password created from the list of prompts. 
I created a for loop to account for the length of each password once prompted
I asked that the password be between 8 and 128 characters.
